# Architecture

## Pipeline (one path, no bypass)
```
scrape ─► score (≥70 gate) ─► NPPES size gate (free) ─► enrich (Clay waterfall)
       ─► write sequence (Sonnet, cluster-routed) ─► Cleanlist verify ─► SalesBlink send
       ─► reply ─► Close CRM handoff
```
- **scrape** — `pipeline/scrape.py` (JobSpy: Indeed live, LinkedIn actor; free boards). Dedupe on `sha1(company|title)`. 14-day window.
- **score** — `pipeline/score.py`, driven entirely by `lib/scoring/rubric.config.json`. Deterministic keyword pass; in production Claude Haiku refines the ambiguous 40–69 band using feedback few-shots. Same code path in cron and dashboard — the old app's two-scorer split (keyword in cron, "AI" on a button) is gone.
- **size gate** — free NPPES provider-count lookup before any paid credit. Kills hospitals/large orgs.
- **enrich → write → send** — Clay (waterfall), Sonnet sequences routed by title cluster (front_desk / billing_rcm / records_dataentry / general_va), Cleanlist verify, SalesBlink on warmed domains, Close on reply.

## The learning loop (eval-gated — the part the old app faked)
```
feedback ─► few-shot (pgvector kNN over feedback) ─► distilled learned_rules (decay/dedup)
        ─► candidate scoring_version ─► EVAL on locked 61-holdout ─► promote iff (≥ baseline AND ≥ 90% AND no worse false-disqualify)
```
- **Feedback** is first-class history (verdict + reason_tags + corrected_score + note), many per posting.
- **Eval gate** (`lib/eval/eval_holdout.py`): a candidate must beat the baseline on the frozen 61-entry human holdout before it goes active. Seed run: baseline (old AI) 67.2% / 20 lost → candidate (v1.0) 77.0% / 4 lost.
- **Active-learning queue**: postings nearest the 70 gate surface first (uncertainty sampling) so feedback effort is maximally useful.

## Single source of truth
`lib/scoring/rubric.config.json` — weights, flags, caps, gate, title clusters, outreach flags. Read by the Python scorer today and the TS scorer in the Next.js/Supabase build. The re-orientation from job-seeker → staffing-seller lives here (notably: US work-authorization is NOT a disqualifier; senior titles are; US coding certs deprioritize).

## Surfaces
- **web/** — the mobile-first DRY-RUN dashboard (static, deploys anywhere). Screens: Pipeline, Review, Learning, Tools, Why-better.
- **mcp/server.js** — Claude MCP server exposing the pipeline as tools (`list_leads`, `submit_feedback`, `run_eval`, `teach_rule`, `pipeline_status`, `learning_status`). Add to Claude Desktop/Code to operate the whole system conversationally.
- **Next.js + Supabase (planned P2)** — the full-stack app: auth-gated dashboard, API routes, Postgres + pgvector, the tables in the plan (`companies`, `job_postings`, `scores`, `feedback`, `scoring_versions`, `learned_rules`, `eval_runs`, `labeled_holdout`, `contacts`, `sequences`, `integrations`). The current `web/` is its DRY-RUN front-end.

## MCP quick add (Claude Desktop / Code)
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "quickteam-outbound": { "command": "node", "args": ["<repo>/mcp/server.js"] } } }
